====TraML====
TraML is a new standardized format for encoding transition lists and associated metadata developed by the [http://www.psidev.info/ Proteomics Standards Initiative].

TraML builds on the same design concepts that were used for [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20716697 mzML] and mzIdentML. Like these formats previously developed for different data types, TraML is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) and can be parsed and validated for structural correctness with a large variety of industry-standard tools. As with the other PSI formats, most of the metadata in the TraML file are encoded with the use of controlled vocabulary (CV) terms. These terms are all included in the PSI-MS CV, the same CV used by mzML and mzIdentML, and actively maintained by the PSI MSSWG.

====jTraML====
The jTraML project is a Java API for the Proteomics Standards Initiative TraML data standard. The library provides fully functional classes for all elements specified in the TraML XSD document, as well as convenient methods to construct controlled vocabulary based instances required to define SRM transitions.

The use of jTraML is demonstrated via a two-way conversion tool between TraML documents and vendor specific files, facilitating the adoption process of this new community standard.

The library is released as open source under the permissive [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 Apache2 license], and can be downloaded from [http://jtraml.googlecode.com http://jtraml.googlecode.com].

TraML files can also be converted online at [http://iomics.ugent.be/jtraml http://iomics.ugent.be/jtraml].
