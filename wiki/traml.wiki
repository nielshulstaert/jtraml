= Introduction =

TraML is a new standardized format for encoding transition lists and associated metadata developed by the [http://www.psidev.info/ Proteomics Standards Initiative] . In addition to introducing the TraML format, we demonstrate several implementations across the community, and provide semantic validators and extensive documentation to ensure proper implementation, and multiple example files to demonstrate correct implementations. Widespread use of TraML will facilitate the exchange of transitions, reduce time spent handling incompatible list formats, increase the reusability of previously optimized transitions, and thus accelerate and facilitate the field of targeted proteomics via SRM.
