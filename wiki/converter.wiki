In this interface, the user must first select the required species from a drop-down list and insert peptide sequences with optional quantitative attributes before starting the transformation. The returning peptides are then annotated with gene model coordinates and can be downloaded in Sequence Alignment/Map format SAM file for visualization in client genome browsers like the Integrated Genome Viewer ([http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/ IGV]).
