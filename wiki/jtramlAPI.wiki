==== Reduced UML diagram ====

The *TraMLType* is the root element of the TraML file. Central in this diagram are the *TransitionType* and *CompoundType/PeptideType* elements which represent all transitions that need to be analyzed in a SRM experiment. Note that a PeptideType in term references a *ProteinType*, and also links to a RetentionTimeType element in order to define expected chromatographic elution times.

Aside from these JAXB generated classes, the reduced UML diagram highlights jTraML convenience classes such as the *CVFactory* and the *OboManager*, both working together to detail each of the TraML elements with *Controlled Vocabulary based Parameters*.  

Furthermore, the *TSVFileImportModel* and *TSVFileExportModel* declare a conversion interface for generating TraML or TSV files respectively. The *SepToTRAMLJob* and the *TRAMLToSepJob* in turn make use of these models for threaded conversion of SRM input files.
